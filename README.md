======

Gleany is game utility library written in Scala wrapping 
[libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx). 

The library contains utilities to ease game making, such as:

- simplified interface for creating and managing OpenGL shaders and offscreen buffers
- less painful/rigid functions and semantics for drawing 2D sprites
- crash reporting and hardware diagnostics
- simple audio management and playback
- resource loading
- saving of game settings
- fluid simulation
- Tiled map loading
- streamlined input querying

Gleany is in active development and is still in its early stages. 
Feel free to use it, but expect many breaking changes!
